# MergeSort
Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It is a comparison-based algorithm that uses a divide and conquer strategy to sort a collection of items. It is a stable sorting algorithm and is more efficient than many other sorting algorithms in most situations. It is also a comparison-based algorithm, which means that it compares elements to each other to determine their order. Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, which means that it preserves the order of equal elements in the sorted output. This makes it useful for sorting data that has multiple fields, such as a list of people sorted by last name and then by first name. Merge sort is also a comparison-based algorithm, which means that it compares elements to each other to determine their order.

## Algorithm
   divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
