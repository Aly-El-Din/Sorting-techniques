# InsertionSort
Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

## Algorithm
The algorithm works by iterating through the input array from the second element to the last, and for each element, it compares it with the previous elements and swaps it with the previous elements until it is in the correct position.
